Welcome to story time, where books come alive. In the darkest corner of Pine Hollow, where even the stars seem to whisper secrets, lived Jean the Bat, a little reader with a big imagination. By day, she napped in the rafters of an old bell tower. But by night, she soared beneath the moon with her journal tucked beneath her wing. Jean collected stories—forgotten fables, hidden histories, and legends lost to time—writing each one carefully upside down in her little book.

One chilly night, as she skimmed over the treetops, a silver glow flickered across the clouds, followed by a sound like pages fluttering in the wind. Jean stopped mid-flight and listened.

The sound grew louder, not like normal wind, but like thousands of books opening at once. She followed the sound to the edge of the sky, where a pale beam of moonlight shimmered like a staircase made of stars.

*Welcome to the Library in the Moon.*

Without hesitation, Jean flapped toward it, wings steady, heart thumping, until she reached a glowing archway carved into the moon itself. Inside was a grand floating library: shelves suspended in air, scrolls gliding like birds, and books whispering to each other as they flew past. Jean gasped, her glasses fogging up as a book with glowing runes zipped past her and opened to a page titled, "The Story Thief."

A golden owl wearing a librarian's pendant greeted her. "Welcome, Jean," the owl said. "The library in the moon chooses only those who honor forgotten tales." Jean blinked, stunned. "You know my name?" she asked. The owl nodded. "Every story you've ever written found its way here. They remembered you."

The owl led her to a reading nook nestled inside a crater window where a book waited with her name stitched in silver across the spine. Jean opened it carefully. Inside were tales she hadn't written yet—stories from places she hadn't visited but somehow already dreamed about. The pages shimmered, showing misty forests, singing stones, and castles that only existed in whispers, waiting for her to give them a voice.

Then the owl grew solemn. "But something is wrong," it warned. "A story thief has crept in, stealing unwritten tales before they’re born. We need your help." Jean stood tall, her journal clutched tight. "I'll find the thief. No story should be silenced before it’s told."

She flew between the shifting shelves, searching for gaps—places where stories should have lived, but were now silent as dust. Finally, near a cracked scroll case, she spotted the culprit. It was a shadowy creature with ink-stained claws, stuffing shimmering pages into a broken satchel. Jean dove, flipping midair, and flung her journal like a boomerang.

*The Stories Fight Back.*

The journal struck the satchel, and the stolen stories burst free in glowing ribbons. The shadow screeched and vanished in a puff of smoke, leaving Jean surrounded by floating stories that hummed gratefully as they returned home.

The owl returned, eyes wide with pride. "You've saved more than tales tonight," it praised. "You've guarded imagination itself." Jean smiled shyly, then tucked her journal back under her wing. "There are more stories out there," she murmured. "I just have to find them." Before she left, the owl handed her a tiny silver bookmark shaped like a wing. "You're always welcome in the library in the moon."

Jean soared home as dawn kissed the horizon, her journal now glowing faintly, ready to hold the next story only she could find.
