The story of The Big Bad Wolf and his Magic Vacuum Cleaner, by Pratana Guraj, began with a faint *tap, tap, tap* on the door. Inside her little straw house, Painter Pig was busy painting flying cars. "Who is it?" she called out. All she heard was a low growl in answer. "No, could it be? Could it really, really be the Big Bad Wolf again?" she worried.

"Come, come, little pig. Step out of your silly straw house," growled the Big Bad Wolf. "Never!" squealed Painter Pig, holding her paintbrushes tight. "Aha," said the Wolf. "I knew you would say that, so I have a new trick for you today." The Wolf took out a magic vacuum cleaner from his piggy bag and began his magic spell: "Vroom, zoom, vacuum, suck away this silly straw house." *Vroom*, roared the vacuum cleaner, and *whoosh*, it sucked away the little straw house completely. The Wolf quickly grabbed Painter Pig and put her into his piggy bag.

*The captured pigs, led by Baker Pig, devise a cunning strategy to reclaim their freedom.*

Meanwhile, Singer Pig stood near her window, singing with her cats in the house she had built from bamboo sticks. "How well you sing, Little Pig. Come, come, step out of your little bamboo house," growled the Big Bad Wolf. "Not again," squealed Singer Pig. "You know I will never step out, Wolf. Go away." "Aha," he replied, flashing an evil grin. "I was hoping you would say that, because I get to use my new magic vacuum cleaner." He began the chant: "Vroom, zoom, vacuum, suck away this bamboo house." *Vroom*, roared the vacuum cleaner, and *whoosh*, it sucked away the bamboo house. Singer Pig held onto her violin, but the Big Bad Wolf grabbed her and put her into his piggy bag, too.

Off went the Wolf to Baker Pig’s house. Now, Baker Pig had a home built from sturdy bricks. "Come, come, Baker Pig. Please let me taste that delicious cake you are making," the Wolf said in his sweetest voice. "Never! You are not fooling me, Big Bad Wolf. Go away," warned Baker Pig, grabbing her rolling pin. The Wolf grinned, showing all his scary, big teeth. "Aha! I was hoping you would say that because now I get to use my magic vacuum cleaner." He began his magic spell: "Vroom zoom vacuum suck away this wooden door." *Vroom!* The vacuum cleaner came to life. *Whoosh!* It sucked the door away. The Big Bad Wolf ran in, grabbed Baker Pig, and put her into his piggy bag.

Back at the Wolf’s house, the pigs tumbled out of the piggy bag. "Work for me and I won't eat you," he said in a rumbly, grumbly voice. He then quickly hid his magic vacuum cleaner under the bed. "How do we get out of here?" squealed Painter Pig. "We need to get our hands on that magic vacuum cleaner," said Singer Pig. "But how?" asked Painter Pig again. "He hides it under his bed, and he never leaves it alone." "Oink. I have an idea," grunted Baker Pig. "Listen." She leaned in and whispered something into their ears. The pigs had a plan.

The next morning, Baker Pig baked the most delicious cake. "Yum! I smell cake! I love cake!" the Wolf exclaimed, waking up with a yawn and showing his very scary teeth. He walked into the kitchen, and there it was: a big, delicious cake sitting on the table. The Wolf immediately sat down and began gobbling up the cake. *Yum, yum, yum.*

Singer Pig played the violin and sang a happy song. The Wolf began to sing along, too. Painter Pig began to dance, tapping her paintbrushes on the table like drumsticks. Soon, the Wolf was dancing wildly around the table. He certainly forgot all about his magic vacuum cleaner.

*Vroom, zoom! The tables have turned as the pigs use the magic vacuum cleaner to capture the Big Bad Wolf.*

Now was the moment. Baker Pig quietly crept under the Wolf's bed and pulled out the magic vacuum cleaner. "Vroom, zoom! Vacuum! and suck up this Big Bad Wolf," she commanded. *Vroom!* The vacuum cleaner came to life. It chased the Big Bad Wolf all over the room, and *whoosh*, into the vacuum cleaner went the Wolf, still clutching his cake. "Let me out!" growled the Wolf. "Not a chance," said the three little pigs. "I'll get you all. I will catch you again, I promise," grumbled the Wolf. "Not today," laughed the three little pigs. They then cleaned the rest of the house with their now very noisy vacuum cleaner. The End.
