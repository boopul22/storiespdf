Jerome took a stroll along the snowy streets with his rescue dog, Ekko. He felt inspired to collect words—holiday words, words of hope, words of joy—words to give to those he loved, both family and friends. Notebook in hand, Jerome began his search for words throughout his town. While he loved collecting language around him, many of the words he read did not seem very inspiring: "Sale," "Super Sale," "Last Minute Sale," "Buy, Buy Now," "Cheap Stuff," "Even Cheaper." These were not holiday words; they did not warm his heart. These commercial words left Jerome feeling cold.

He encountered more cold words, loud and sharp, as he clasped his empty notebook. Feeling discouraged, Jerome decided to listen for words instead. But the words he heard were not collectible: "I hate this weather," "Move it," "Hurry up," "I want it now," and "I'm lonely." They were unhappy, frustrated, and impatient words.

Just when Jerome thought he’d never find the words he longed for, he had an idea. If he couldn’t find inspiration in the words he was encountering, what if he could find a way to give the world the words it needed? Jerome raced back home, Ekko trying to keep up with him, and found his treasured word collection—words he had carefully curated for years. His favorite words were joyful words, festive words, and kind words.

*Inspired, Jerome loads his sled with his vast collection of joyful words to share with the world.*

Jerome loaded his sled full of his favorite positive words and headed to the downtown park. He put a call out to everyone to join him in decorating a tree with words—a holiday tree. Ekko barked excitedly. Jerome envisioned "A Word Collector's Tree, a Tree of Hope, a Tree of Dreams, a Tree of Wishes. Add your joyful words, dreams, wishes, positive words." As Jerome surveyed the site, people from his community, young and old, family and friends, gathered.

"Happy holidays," Jerome trumpeted. "Add your own favorite words to the tree. Share the love!" Words appeared quickly: "Joy," "Smile," "Happy New Day," "Together We Can," "Possibilities," "Be Present," "Savor Each Moment," and "Listen." His sister added a string of words to the tree, saying she was grateful for all the helpers. A friend added, "I dream of a world with no hunger." Friends and family busily added words, some stringing them together. Jerome searched his collection and found just the right words to express his own wish. He hung his words high atop the tree, where they looked like a triumphant flag: "Peace on Earth, Goodwill to All, Love."

*The community gathers around the Word Collector's Tree, celebrating shared hope and love illuminated by shimmering positive words.*

Ekko barked enthusiastically. Jerome understood the message and wrote, "Love to furry friends far and wide." The tree was now filled with the light of so many wonderful words from so many kind hearts. Jerome's words had successfully brought people and animals together. There were so many words strung together, shimmering and dreamy—so many positively powerful words. And that was the gift of words: a gift for all. Share your positive words. May they inspire peace on earth. Peter H. Reynolds.

Now, consider some questions about the story. What was your favorite part of this book? Pause the video after each question to draw, write, and discuss your answers. What happened to the story first, next, then, and last? What is the setting of the story, meaning when and where does it happen? Who is in the story? Name the characters and describe their traits. What is the main conflict or problem in the story? How and why do the characters respond to the problem and solve it? What do the characters learn in the story, and what can you learn from them? What is the lesson or theme? In other words, what can you learn from the story, and how can you apply it to your own life? One good reading skill is to go back and reread. Peter H. Reynolds, the author who wrote this book, had a purpose in writing it. He said, "Share your positive words. May they inspire peace on earth." What are some words you would like to add to this tree? Make a list of all the positive words you would like to add. Write your dreams, wishes, and positive words that bring light to yourself, your loved ones, and your community. You can make artwork that has words on top of the art, or cut and paste words to glue on top of artwork and make a collage with positive images and words. You can also make a vision board that includes things that help you feel peaceful and calm and that inspire you to achieve your goals and dreams with images and words. You can display these in your room to make yourself feel positive when you wake up and go to sleep at night. Think of something you can do to make your family and community feel positive and hopeful this holiday season. You might create a tree of words at your school or in your community. Alternatively, you could host another charitable cause, like a street cleanup to remove litter and make your community more beautiful and hopeful. You could also plan a fundraiser to give to people in need, such as those who require food.
