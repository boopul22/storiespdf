Welcome back, bookworms. This is Mrs. K, and I'm glad you could join me. Thanksgiving week had just begun, but something wasn't right. The turkey tray was empty; not a drumstick was in sight. In this funny story, the turkeys disappear before the holiday, crying, "No more baste! We've got big dreams to chase." They are tired of being dinner and want to do so much more. Let's enjoy the magic of reading as we explore *Turkeys on Strike*, written and illustrated by Jennifer Jones, and see if the turkeys’ demands are met and if they return in time for Thanksgiving. Look at Sir Gobble—he wants to be a juggler, a singer, and a baker! My, they certainly don't look happy. Once again, Thanksgiving week had just begun, but the turkey tray was empty.

"What? No gravy, wings, or turkey legs!" The whole flock flew the coop. Instead, a note was left behind, signed by the feather group. "We quit," declared the turkeys. Oh my. The turkeys had staged a clever strike, a feathered, peaceful stand. "We've had enough," they shouted loud. "Please try to understand! No more baste! Gobble, don't wobble! Respect the pec! No roasting, basting, or baking us! We've got big dreams to chase. We'd rather dance and tell some jokes than end up on your plate." "Oh my," the readers exclaimed. "We quit!"

*The turkeys stage a clever strike, shouting their demands to be seen as singers, dancers, and artists, not food.*

That morning, something strange appeared: a letter, big and bold. It even had a feather for a stamp, with stories waiting to be told. The recipient looked surprised. The turkey note read: “Dear students, we know you’re feeling blue, but we’re more than just dinner birds. We have big feelings, too. We’re singers, dancers, and party birds. We juggle, paint, and twirl! But every fall, we disappear, just one big roasted swirl. If you could see us as your friends, not food upon a plate, we’d come back from our turkey tents and celebrate that date.”

"We've been treating them like leftovers. We have to fix this," said Miss Yam. The turkeys had made their feelings clear. "Let's show them that we're grateful, too. We want them back this year." The students realized the light bulb appearing over Miss Yam meant she had an idea: a Turkey Talent Show! Other ideas included a "Give Thanks" parade and a birdie spa day. To execute the show, they wrote kind notes with glitter pens and baked some corn-shaped cakes. They even built a stage from lunch trays, complete with sparkly feathered drapes. The theme was clear: "This is gratitude, not gravy."

*The turkeys return with flare and skill for the talent show, proving their worth and celebrating a Thanksgiving based on gratitude, not gravy.*

The turkeys returned with flare and skill. They twirled and danced and sang; one even juggled yams on roller skates while deftly dodging a boomerang. At the party feast, there were pies, mashed potato swirls, and rolls with butter, too. The turkeys happily joined the celebration. "Hooray!" cheered Sir Gobbles. Now, every year, they all give thanks with joy and extra pie. The turkeys get to dance and laugh, not wave the day goodbye. The students cheered, saying, "Thanks for everything!" The lesson learned was simple: if your food goes on a break or vanishes one night, just show some love and gratitude. It might just make things right. The narrator humorously mused, "Elves on strike next? Ooh, the North Pole!"
