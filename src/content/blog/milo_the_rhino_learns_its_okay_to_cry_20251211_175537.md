"Hello, I'm Danny," the narrator began. "Oh, I'm not crying. I've just got something in my eye, and someone is chopping onions over there. Well, maybe I am crying a little bit, but that's okay because it's good to cry. When you're having tricky feelings, you should try and let them out because it can make you feel better." He noted that everyone cries, "Even grown-ups—in fact, especially grown-ups. Someone may look big or tough, but they have the same big feelings that you do. Never judge a book by its cover. Although, this one is about a rhino. It's called *Rhinos Don't Cry*, and it's by Mark Grist with illustrations by Chris Javans."

The story began with Milo. Milo was a rhino who loved to do all sorts of rhinoy things. He enjoyed writing and climbing, sliding down banisters, and mountain bike riding. He painted and he sang. "And goodness me, Milo loves being a rhino," the narrator affirmed. But there was one small problem: Rhinos don't cry. *Rhinos don't cry? Are you sure? Is that right?*

Well, that is what Milo discovered one night when he and his mom were watching TV. His hero, the movie star Spike McCree, was digging up treasure when pirates attacked. They had taken the lot and would not give it back. That is when Spike said, "I am a hero, and I'll tell you why. Bad things might happen, but rhinos don't cry." From that moment on, Milo decided that crying was bad, and like Spike, he would fight it. *“I am a rhino, and rhinos don’t cry. I am a rhino, and rhinos don’t cry,”* he affirmed to himself.

But then something awful happened. Mom announced, "Oh no, Pickles got out and hasn't come home." Milo felt sad. It was hard not to cry, but he thought about Spike, and he knew he should try to hold it in. That morning, he sat with Mom in the kitchen and helped her make signs that said, "Pickles is missing." Each sign had a picture and a number to call in case anyone had seen Pickles at all. When he thought about Pickles, Milo felt funny in his head, his chest, and his little round tummy. And that funny feeling did not go away for the rest of a very long day.

Milo and his mom put up the signs they had made on fences, lampposts, and shop windows. Outside the cinema, with just one sign left, Milo looked around for the best place. *Here,* he thought, sticking it by the side door. But then he heard a deep voice say, "Now what is that sign for?" Milo felt panicked and all in a muddle. The voice was so loud—was he in trouble? He turned to say sorry, when who did he see? Wow. The great rhino movie star, Spike McCree. Milo was shocked; he didn't know what to do. This was the movie star he knew! He showed him the poster he’d made about Pickles.

But just as he did, his eyes started to trickle. Milo tried. He tried. Milo really, really tried. But he cried. Milo cried and he cried and he cried and he cried. A fountain of tears poured from his eyes. And as Milo cried, what did Spike McCree then do? Well, Spike McCree began to cry too. How red his cheeks went! How much his tears poured! He would have come first at the crying awards.

*Milo bursts into tears while talking to Spike McCree, only for his tough hero to match his sobs, showing vulnerability.*

"What are you doing?" asked Milo, confused. "I'm crying, of course," said Spike. "Aren't you?" "But you mustn't," said Milo to Spike McCree. "You said so! I heard you last night on TV. You are my hero," he said with a sigh, "and we are both rhinos, and rhinos don't cry." "Ah!" Spike frowned. "That film? Yes, I know. Well, the thing is that was made a long time ago, before we found out how important it is to cry sometimes—and not just for kids, but for adults as well. It's how we were made. In fact, you know what? I think crying is brave." So Milo and Spike both let their tears pour as Milo’s mom found them beside the side door. Spike’s suit jacket was certainly wetter, but after he had cried, Milo felt better.

They all shared a smile. "Then hang on. What was that? *Meow.* That sounded like Pickles the cat!" "Pickles!" yelled Milo. "Did you hear us crying? She's on that pirate ship! That's where she was hiding." "Goodness," said Mom. "Let's fetch her quick." "I'll get her," said Spike. But he couldn't fit.

*Milo, now feeling brave and happy, rushes into the pirate ship movie set to rescue his lost cat, Pickles.*

Milo, however, was small and Milo was fast. He rescued Pickles, and she was safe at last. Mom cuddled Pickles. Spike looked at Milo and said, "Milo, you are my hero. What a brave rhino." They laughed and they cried and were dancing about until it was time to head back to the house. On the way home, Milo could tell they were crying because they were happy as well. Milo felt great. You just couldn't deny that it was good to be brave, and it was okay to cry.

"Oh, you've only gone and set me off again now, haven't you, Milo?" the narrator chuckled. "Now whether it's big blubbery bursts or snively sobs, if you feel like you need to cry, belt it out loud and proud. Like Spike says, crying is brave. It's brave to cry because you're showing the world how you really feel." He advised that if someone you know is crying, you might want to ask them if they are all right and offer them a hug, or maybe give a thumbs up to check they are okay. "Another time people cry is when they're a bit tired. So don't fight the sleep. Look after yourself and go to bed. Good night. Oh, Milo. Proper brave geezer."
