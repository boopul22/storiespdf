In a room with AC, a family of 25 people—with an aarti plate, Shanti welcomes her new daughter-in-law. "Come, come, the Lakshmi of my house, a special welcome to your in-laws' house." Nisha pushes down the ceremonial pot and enters. Standing in a crowd of 22-25 people, the daughter-in-law starts sweating. "One, I'm drenched in sweat. These in-laws are staring at me as if I've come from a third planet. I'm feeling very suffocated. Let me breathe some air."

Then sister-in-law Aunt Sampark turns on the ceiling fan in the hall. "New daughter-in-law, is the breeze reaching your body or not? This is a storm-speed fan. It gives very fast breeze. Is the air reaching your body or not?" "Aunt, what breeze? This fan has completely broken down. Someone please turn on the AC." Suffering from the heat, Nisha looks around. But there's no AC anywhere in the hall.

Shortly, her dowry items arrive. Among them were a Godrej wardrobe, furniture, table, chair, dining table, and an expensive AC. Seeing it, everyone's eyes widen. "Oh my, dear mother-in-law. Look, the new daughter-in-law's parents have sent an AC in the dowry." Seeing the AC, the elder mother-in-law burns with jealousy and says, "Oh Shanti, is mothichoor laddoo bursting in your heart? From now on you're going to sleep very happily in AC breeze." "Seeing my daughter-in-law's AC, your kidneys seem to have turned red. Why Aunt, you also sleep in the AC. I'll install the AC in my room." Hearing this, Nisha speaks up. "But mother-in-law, my parents gave this AC for my use." "Babe, you're talking as if we're going to eat your AC." "Hey Pooja, why are you fighting with sister-in-law as soon as she came?" "Daughter-in-law, this is your dowry AC. You set it up in your room."

*Dowry AC, greedy eyes of the in-law family.*

"Thank you Father Ji." Nisha quickly gets the workers who came to unload the goods to install the AC in the room and turns it on. Within a short while, the room becomes cold as ice. "Ah, how good that I asked Papa to get a Panasonic AC in my dowry." Soon the room becomes as cool as Shimla Manali. "Prem Ji, come quickly." "Coming, baby." "Nobody's in the room. What a happy moment! Today let's have some fun, we'll see about the rest tomorrow." As Prem approaches Nisha in a romantic manner, the in-law crowd gathers outside the room. "Aunt, Uncle, open the door." "That's Araav's voice." "One minute baby, coming." As soon as Prem opens the door, 22 to 23 people—big aunt, big uncle, uncle, aunt, two Nandinis, sister-in-law and their children—enter the room with pillows and mats. The manager of that group, grandmother mother-in-law, comes last. "Ah, this AC blows such cool air." "Mother, AC is a great thing in summer. Okay, elder daughter-in-law, lay everyone's beds." "Ah, are all of you going to sleep in our room?" "Hey, did we come to make pickle in your room in the middle of the night? Great-granddaughter-in-law, we came to sleep in the AC. Now don't stand there like a date palm blocking the bed, move, let us sleep." Only Ramkali spreads out on the bed and lies down. "Great grandma, great grandma, we're also going to sleep on the bed with you." "Come, come, my dear grandchildren, great-grandchildren." Before their eyes, the in-law crowd of 25 spreads from the bed all over the floor. Nisha has no place. "Prem Ji, your shameless relatives and family have no respect at all. They've come in like a bone in kebab." "Nisha, actually there's no AC in the other rooms. So please adjust for my sake." "Fine. But only for today." Poor daughter-in-law settles in a corner. There the AC breeze barely reaches. On top of that, her sleep is disturbed by the in-laws' snoring sounds and gas releases. "Oh, yuck yuck yuck, I feel like someone dropped a NASA bomb. Even my nose hair got burned." Frustrated, Nisha sleeps on the hall sofa in the heat.

At exactly 5 o'clock, Ramkali comes. "New daughter-in-law, oh daughter-in-law, wake up quickly." "Grandma Ji, let me sleep." "After marriage, should you wake up in the morning to shoo flies? Oh God, she's giving back answers. Hey, daughters-in-law of the house are Lakshmi of the house. Wake up, take the broom and sweep, make tea." Yawning, the poor daughter-in-law starts sweeping. "Look, how everyone is sleeping in my AC snoring like Kumbhakarna. I'm getting angry." In anger, the daughter-in-law turns off the AC. Because of this, Aunt Lilavati grumbles. "Oh Rama, how did it get so hot in this room? Hey daughter-in-law, why did you turn off the AC? Turn it on." "Aunt Ji, it's morning. All of you wake up. I need to sweep." "Hey, you can sweep later. No auspicious time is passing by." Leaving aside sweeping the room, Nisha bathes, prepares tea and breakfast, and places it on the table. "Big Uncle Ji, Big Aunt Ji, Uncle, Aunt, Sister-in-law Ji, everyone come. Breakfast is ready." "I don't feel like leaving the AC. Daughter-in-law, bring the breakfast to the room." Hearing this, sweat-drenched Nisha's anger increases further. "Honestly, this is unfair. First, I prepared tea and breakfast in boiling heat like a stove. Now I have to take this to the room and serve them? Nobody can move even one step. I don't know when they'll leave from here." Everyone eats breakfast while breathing in AC air. Then Nisha asks, "Aunt Ji, Uncle Aunt, Big Uncle, Big Aunt, tell me when you're leaving for the train. Should I make dry potato puri?" "Why daughter-in-law? We're not going anywhere to roam or wander." "But now the wedding is over. You should go to your homes." Hearing what Nisha said, Nandini Khushbu says, "Babe, you're cooking pulao in your imagination. Hey, our family is a joint family of 25 people. Nobody is going anywhere from here." Hearing about the joint in-law family of 25 people, Nisha feels like a 440-volt electric shock. "Hey God, I'm feeling very dizzy. This priest said small family and trapped me in a family as big as a district." Tonight also all members sleep in the daughter-in-law's AC room. Days pass like this. "Sister-in-law Ji, Khushbu, Pooja, all of you please move aside a bit. I'm not getting space to sleep." "This spot is permanent for me. I need to breathe AC air." "Babe, this is my fixed spot too. You find another place." "This is unfair. Once their work is done, who cares about others." "All day they make me cook like I'm making halwa for these bedbug-like people. At night I don't even get AC air." Frustrated, Nisha lies down in the middle. Because of this, she gets drenched in sweat. Two or three weeks pass like this.

*Room crowd chaos: 25 people sleeping in AC.*

Being mostly in heat without any air, blisters develop on Nisha's body. "Oh, these blisters are biting my whole body like ants." Then Prem comes to the kitchen. "Nisha, your health has become very bad. Blood is even coming from these blisters. Come, I'll take you to the doctor." Seeing the bad condition, Prem takes Nisha to the doctor. "Look, because of continuously working in heat, excess heat has accumulated in her body. Keep her in AC coolness." "Okay, thank you doctor." When Prem brought Nisha home, everyone was sitting in the room with the AC on. There was a lot of garbage scattered. The plates from eating were lying there, last night's bedding wasn't picked up. Children were jumping around. "Big sister-in-law, didn't you feel like at least folding last night's bedding? Look at the condition of the room. It's worse than a garbage bin. At least if you're enjoying the AC comfort, clean together too." "Hey son, what happened? Why are you so angry?" "Papa, Nisha's health is not good. The doctor told her to breathe AC air. All of you let her rest." "Nothing has happened. She's acting sick so she can breathe AC air and not work. Sit down everyone." None of the shameless in-laws moved from the AC. Because of this, Nisha faints and falls down from the heat. Prem gets angry at everyone. "Nisha, Nisha, open your eyes. See, taking care of all of you, poor thing's condition has become so bad." "Brother-in-law, don't worry. I'll make lemonade and bring it." Everyone starts taking care of Nisha together. Now the in-laws stop coming to the daughter-in-law's AC room. Prem installs another AC at home on installment within a few days. This solves the problem.

6 AM early morning. Near the riverbank, Asha's entire family was sleeping on cots outside. But the younger daughter-in-law Vidhi was sitting on the cot, scratching herself, sleep-deprived from the heat. At that time, a new family is bringing their belongings and moving into a nearby house. Their daughter-in-law Nisha, seeing everyone sleeping outside on the riverbank, says, "These people are still sleeping outside on the riverbank. They're making daughters-in-law sleep too. What kind of people are they. Can't they install an AC or cooler in this much heat? But no, they must be sleeping outside to save money, what else?" "Hey daughter-in-law, leave them. It's very hot outside. Come inside." "Mother, you said it right." Saying this much, Shanti goes inside with her family. There the whole family cleans the house together. After a while, they turn on the AC and sit in the hall. "Mother, how hot it is. Only after turning on the AC there's relief, right?" While the modern family relaxes in AC, near the riverbank, Vidhi keeps feeling sleepy again and again because she didn't sleep properly. "Daughter-in-law, were you hitting mosquitoes all night? Is that why you're sleeping again and again while mopping the floor?" "Ma Ji, it was very hot at night. So poor Vidhi couldn't sleep properly. But don't worry, I've explained to her." "Good, it's good you explained. Because this is not her birth home, it's in-laws' house." "Okay Diwakar, it's getting late for work." Saying this, Amit and Diwakar leave for work. After a while, Asha takes her two daughters-in-law and goes to the new neighbors' house. At the housewarming puja, breathing in the AC's cool air, both daughters-in-law are very happy.

A few days pass like this. One night, as Vidhi and Nikita are going outside with pillows and blankets, Vidhi asks, "Sister, how do you sleep here every year without AC or cooler? In my birth home, there was a cooler. I didn't feel this much heat. Here all of them sleep in the open near the riverbank. The river's stink and heat are too much. I can't sleep outside like this." "In in-laws' house, some adjustment has to be made. But don't worry. I'll go outside and talk to Ma Ji. If they agree, we can go sleep on the terrace." At night, Nikita comes outside. Amit and Diwakar are sleeping on cots near the riverbank with their mother. Nikita wakes up her mother-in-law and talks to her. After that, Asha goes with her two daughters-in-law to sleep on the terrace. "Sleep here. You won't feel the heat here. See, what nice breeze is blowing. When nature gives such nice breeze, what's the need for AC cooler? For many centuries, people have been sleeping in the open. This AC and all are modern people's show-offs." In front of their mother-in-law, Vidhi and Nikita don't say anything and try to sleep by laying the mattress. But even on the terrace, mosquitoes bite them. So Vidhi can't sleep. For the first time, along with Vidhi, Nikita also wakes up late in the morning. Before they wake up, Diwakar and Amit who came to the terrace start shouting seeing them still sleeping. "Sister-in-law, Vidhi, hasn't it dawned for you two? The sun has risen high, they have no awareness." "Sorry, my eyes just didn't open today." "Okay Vidhi, let's all come down." Then Vidhi says, "The heat is too much. We went to sleep on the terrace. Mosquitoes didn't let us sleep. We just dozed off, so we couldn't wake up. I'm saying, even if we don't have AC at home, at least we can get this cooler. Look, the new neighbors have AC at their home. Two days ago there was a housewarming puja, I saw then." "Daughter-in-law, stop talking by looking at others. They are modern people. But we are people connected to the soil, understand?" As soon as Vidhi said this much, Asha gets angry. Diwakar and Amit also frown and leave from there.

Time passes like this. One day, both daughters-in-law see another AC being installed at their neighbor's house. "Yes brother, put this AC's pipe here too. The AC water will go to the river outside." "Hey, what are you two watching standing in this sun? Come inside. In this way, we'll also become friends." "Sister, Ma Ji has gone to the shop." "It's okay, we can go inside for a while. We'll get to eat AC air too." Due to Vidhi's insistence, Nikita goes with her to Nisha's house. There they sit in the cool AC air. Kajal brings tea and snacks for everyone. "I saw you unable to sleep all night. When I came here the first day, poor Vidhi was in a sleepy state. What kind of in-laws' house do you have? Don't you say anything?" "What to say? If we say something, everyone gets angry. You would have seen how they got angry at us this morning." "This is very wrong. Okay, we're leaving. Our mother-in-law must have come. If she doesn't see us, she'll get angry again. Anyway, they've told us to stay away from you." Before Asha comes, Nikita and Vidhi come to their house. But they're sweating so much, they can't bear the heat. Now whenever nobody's home, both of them go and sit in the AC at Nisha's house.

Like this one day, Vidhi was vomiting on the riverbank. "Sister, what happened to you? Is your health okay?" "Sister, I can't bear this heat now. I'm feeling dizzy." "It's so hot outside, your health is also not good. Still you're sitting outside the house. Come inside my house. I've told you so many times to come sit at my house when no one's home. Your in-laws won't install AC cooler. Bill has to be paid." "Yes, what my daughter-in-law says is right. Come sit at my house. You'll feel a bit better. Go rest in the room for a while." Hearing what Shanti said, Vidhi and Nikita go to Nisha's room and breathe in AC air. There they feel very relieved. After a while, Nikita also falls asleep. Time passes like this. One night when Amit and Diwakar are laying cots to sleep near the riverbank with their mother, suddenly it rains. They take their bedding and come inside the house. "How heavy it's raining outside. If the water in the river increases, water will start coming inside the house too. Today it has suddenly become cool weather." "From now on we'll all sleep inside the house." "From where did cool weather come? Vidhi's health is not good. Plus rain and heat." "Daughter-in-law, your talk sounds like that modern daughter-in-law's talk. Have you made friends with her behind my back? I told you not to be with her, right?" Hearing Asha's words, Nikita doesn't say anything. The whole family sleeps in the hall with the door open. There no one can sleep because of the heat. At the same time, the rich family was sleeping peacefully in two ACs. They had no feeling about rain or heat.

Then Asha tells her two daughters-in-law, "One thing, it's raining so heavily outside, it's so hot inside. Daughters-in-law, you two fan air with the hand fan for us three mother and sons, only then we can sleep. Anyway, this ceiling fan working or not working is the same thing." Hearing what Asha said, Vidhi and Nikita stay up all night fanning Diwakar, Amit, and Asha with hand fans. So they couldn't sleep. In the morning, because it rained, the water in the river increases. Now when waves rise in the water, dirty water splashes and comes inside the house. Because of this, both daughters-in-law are worried. While mopping the floor outside the house, "One thing, I couldn't sleep the whole night. On top of that this much heat, again and again dirty water is splashing and coming inside the house. How dirty the river water has become. How much stink is coming. Look sister, how much garbage has accumulated on the riverbank." "What can we do now, Vidhi? Let's finish the work quickly and go to Nisha's house." Because both daughters-in-law couldn't sleep all night. So they go to Nisha's house to rest. But when they're not there, Asha comes home, and not seeing her daughters-in-law, goes to Nisha's house and gets angry at her two daughters-in-law sitting in the AC. "Oho, you two have made friends with this modern woman. That's why I'm saying, my daughters-in-law who wouldn't open their mouths in front of me, how are they talking so much today?" "Aunty Ji, think before you speak. This is not your house, it's our house. If your daughters-in-law ask you something, what's wrong? It's so hot, and you're sitting with such old ideas." "Keep your talks to yourself, daughters-in-law, you come home." Asha brings both daughters-in-law home with her and scolds them a lot after coming home.

After a while, at night again Diwakar and Amit start laying cots to sleep near the riverbank outside the house with their mother. But due to the stink, they can't sleep. "After the rain, how dirty the river water has become. So much garbage has accumulated near the riverbank, it's difficult to even breathe. We're going to the terrace to sleep. You all sleep down." Saying this much, both brothers go to sleep on the terrace. There mosquitoes don't let them sleep. Because of incomplete sleep, their health starts deteriorating. "Mother, it's very difficult. My head feels like it's going to burst from headache. Do something, Mother." "Because of the heat, your health is not good. We don't have a cooler or AC at our house. I'll go talk to Nisha. It would be good if you two rest at her house for a while." Nikita and Vidhi, without listening to their mother-in-law, forcefully take their husbands to Nisha's house. There after sleeping in AC the whole day, they come to their house. Coming home, they start sweating. After that, they go to Vinod's house. "Brother, on behalf of our mother, we apologize to you. Okay, we also had old thinking. That's why we didn't listen to our wives' words. Only after resting in AC at your house today, did we realize how much times have changed." "Okay, at least you got a realization, right? There's a lot of difference between old times and today's times. Before, there was natural breeze. But now pollution has increased so much, it's necessary for people to have AC. But if that too is run in moderation, the environment will also be good, and we will also be good." "Son, that's why we all came to you. We've never had AC, so we need your help. It would be good if you could help install AC at our house." Asha, who had hated Vinod and his family, today asks for help from him. Seeing this, both daughters-in-law are very happy. Soon Vinod helps them install AC at their house with his help. This way, friendship develops between both families. Asha too, instead of sleeping outside the house near the riverbank with her sons, the whole family sleeps in the cool AC air.
