A poor mother and her daughters are farming on a snow-covered mountain. "My hands and feet have frozen like ice. I can't even use this crowbar in this cold." "I've gathered all the soil here with the hoe. Now you plant the seeds in this spot and water them well." "Sister, I've picked the vegetables from here. I'm going down with mother to sell them at the market." "Okay, meanwhile I'll water these crops and add fertilizer."

While everyone living in these snow-covered mountain regions was sitting in front of heaters in their homes, resting and relaxing—some drinking hot soup, others warming their hands and feet while eating peanut snacks—Saraswati was doing vegetable farming with her 10 daughters on this snow-covered mountain. But why did things come to such a point for this poor family? Why did they have to farm vegetables on these snowy mountains? To understand this, let's go back a little in the story. [Music]

"Saraswati, I think the time has come for me to go. After I'm gone, please take care of my daughters." "Madhavi, don't say such things. With my prayers, you'll get better." "If you leave us, what will happen to us, Mother? Won't we five sisters become orphans?" "No, my children, you won't become orphans. Your aunt is just like a mother." "Saraswati, will you take care of my daughters?" "I will take care of your daughters just like my own." As soon as Saraswati said this, Madhavi took her last breath. After that, Saraswati performed Madhavi's last rites along with the village people.

"Children, all five of you haven't eaten anything since morning. Here, eat." "No, Aunt. We don't feel like eating at all. You eat." "How can I eat when my children are hungry? How can a mother eat? From today, I'm not your aunt, I'm your mother. Just like my five daughters, from today all five of you are also my daughters. Now I have 10 daughters. Come on, quickly wipe your tears. Let's all eat together."

*First harvest on snowy land; mother and daughters in joy.*

To raise her ten daughters, Saraswati started working on a merchant's farm in the mountains. But as winter began, snow started freezing in the mountains. Because of this, the merchant stopped his farming work and left. Now Saraswati had no work. "What happened, Mother? You look worried." "You all know I've lost my job. Also, due to heavy snowfall this time, this entire mountain has become a snow mountain. I don't know any work other than farming. How will I raise all of you throughout this winter with the little money remaining?"

"But Mother, why have people stopped their field work because of snow?" "Well, because farming can't be done on snow-covered mountains. Who can farm in snow now?" "Actually, farming can be done on snow mountains too. There are countries that are covered with snow throughout the year—farming must happen there too, right?" "Komal is right. Farming can be done even in snowy places. We can easily grow vegetables like carrots, radish, spinach, fenugreek, palak, bottle gourd, ridge gourd, mint, bathua, and coriander. Also, nearby people have stopped farming. So if we grow these vegetables on the snow mountain and sell them, we can earn a lot of money." "But daughter, farming on a snow mountain is not that easy."

"I'll somehow get the seeds. But first, we need to clear the snow. Then dig with the crowbar. Plant the seeds and water them. Also, if the snowfall is heavy, we need to protect the vegetables from snow." "But we have to work hard, don't we? We'll start this work from tomorrow itself." Saraswati brings farming tools like crowbars and hoes. At the same time, all her daughters first clear all the snow from the place where they need to farm. "This snow is so cold. My hands have turned red from removing all this." "Silly girl! Why are you removing snow with bare hands? Wrap cloth around your hands or use this hoe here to remove the snow. We still have a lot of snow to clear. I'm feeling very cold. Just removing this snow is so difficult. I don't know how we'll do vegetable farming on this snow mountain."

"Look here, daughters, I've brought some vegetable seeds. I'll bring the remaining seeds in a few more days. First, let's plant two or four vegetables. If their cultivation goes well, we can plant other vegetables too." The ten sisters and their mother spend the whole day clearing snow. The next day, five sisters dig the ground with the help of crowbars to plant seeds. At the same time, the other five sisters start planting seeds and watering them. A few weeks pass like this. Now slowly vegetables start growing in those fields. Seeing this, everyone is very happy.

"Mother, look, our hard work has paid off! The farming we did on the snow mountains has been successful. Look there, those red carrots have grown, and there's the green spinach! Now we can easily plant the remaining vegetables too. I, Madhu, and Aditi will go with Mother to sell vegetables at the market below. You all do the other farming work." Three sisters along with their mother fill baskets with carrots and spinach, walk down from the snow mountain, and sell them at the market. Meanwhile, the remaining sisters engage in planting other vegetables.

"Oh! Red carrots and spinach! I thought no one would have grown vegetables because of so much snow in the mountains this time. I thought none of us would be able to eat spinach chutney and carrot halwa this year. But you're selling all this here. These aren't injected fake vegetables, are they?" "No, no, Sir. These are real vegetables. If you have doubts, come up the mountain with us and see. Our sisters are doing real vegetable farming there." "Oh, no, no. Who would go to such a snowy mountain? Do one thing. Give me 2 kg spinach and 2 kg carrots. Today I have to get my wife to make carrot halwa and eat it." "Here you go, that's 80 in total." Within a few hours, many people buy all the carrots and spinach from that mother and daughters. Meanwhile, the remaining sisters in the snow mountains were engaged in planting other vegetables.

"Coriander, fenugreek, and mint seeds have been planted. I've watered all the seeds well. Now we have to wait a few more days. Then we can sell all these vegetables. Slowly our family situation will also improve." Soon, the cultivation of other vegetables is also successfully completed. Similarly, all the daughters and mother continue their vegetable farming work in the mountains. Some more time passes like this. But now, slowly the amount of snow on that snow mountain starts increasing. Because of this, the vegetables growing in snowy places also start rotting due to excess snow. "Oh no! What is this? More than half the vegetables have rotted and gone to waste. If it continues like this, all the farming we did in the snow mountains will go to waste. We'll start having troubles and hardships again. I don't understand how we'll protect our vegetables now."

All the daughters and mother are very worried. Two or three days pass like this. The eldest daughter Shalu goes to the library in the city to end this problem, collecting all information related to farming. After that, she goes to a shop and buys large, transparent plastic boxes. "Daughter Shalu, why have you brought so many plastic boxes? What use are these to us?" "This is exactly what we need. In foreign countries, when there's heavy snowfall, people place such transparent boxes over the vegetables and fruits in their fields. This way, the vegetables and fruits get sunlight and don't go to waste." Shalu's idea works. Now none of their vegetables go to waste because of snow. Because of this, some daughters do vegetable farming while other daughters again start selling vegetables at the market with their mother.

"All your vegetables are very fresh. Even after eating, there are no problems in the body. I don't know how you grow vegetables in such snowy mountains." "This is my daughters' skill. If they hadn't told me about this, vegetable farming would never have happened in the snow mountains, and you wouldn't have gotten these vegetables to eat either." Through vegetable farming in the snow mountains, the mother and daughters are now saving a lot of money. With that, they now build a big house in the city below. Also, they continue their vegetable farming work in the snow mountains itself. "Initially, I thought how would I manage my life with 10 daughters. But now I realize, without you 10 daughters, I couldn't have done anything."
