Welcome to story time with Me TV, where books come alive. In the peaceful village of Cloverdale, where the fields stretched far and wide, lived Donald, a young bull with a soft heart and a wild imagination. Every morning, Donald would watch the sun rise over the hills, dreaming of what lay beyond the woods and rivers that bordered his home. Though his friends loved to graze and nap all day, Donald felt a pull in his chest—a call to adventure that he didn't quite understand.

One windy afternoon, Donald overheard the farmer speaking of a magical bridge deep in the valley, a bridge that only the truly brave could cross. That night, under a sky glittering with stars, Donald made a quiet decision: tomorrow he would go find the Bridge of Courage.

With a satchel of clover and a pebble from his mother for luck, Donald set out at dawn. His hooves were steady, but his heart was fluttering. He passed through golden fields where butterflies danced and bees buzzed, greeting old friends who wished him well but warned of the forest ahead.

At the edge of the woods, Donald paused. The trees were tall and close, whispering secrets in the wind. He took a deep breath and stepped inside. The forest was alive with sounds—chirps, rustles, and crackling twigs. Shadows played tricks on him, but he remembered the pebble in his satchel and walked on.

Suddenly, a little rabbit darted out from the bushes, trembling. "A fox is nearby," it whispered. Donald lowered his head. "Follow me. I'll keep you safe." Together, they moved carefully, Donald using his strong frame to shield the rabbit from sight until the danger passed. The rabbit scampered off with profuse thanks.

Feeling braver, Donald reached the forest's heart, where an old owl perched. "To find the Bridge of Courage," said the owl, "you must face your greatest fear." Unsure of what that fear was, Donald thanked the owl and continued, now wondering what he feared most in the world.

Soon, he came to a roaring river. The current was wild, and the bridge ahead was broken. A narrow log was the only way across. Donald's legs trembled. He remembered slipping as a calf into a stream—the cold rush, the fear of being swept away. That memory bubbled up now, chilling him to the bone.

But then he heard a tiny bleat. A baby lamb was stuck halfway across the log, frozen with fear. Without thinking, Donald stepped onto the log.

*Facing the greatest fear to save another.*

Slowly and carefully, he edged across. The log wobbled, and the river roared louder, but he focused only on the lamb's frightened eyes. With one last steady step, he reached the lamb and gently nudged it forward. Together, they crossed, shaky but safe on the other side.

A glow lit the sky ahead. The trees parted, revealing a shimmering golden bridge, arched and glittering, waiting for him in the valley below. As Donald stepped closer, a warm breeze wrapped around him. The bridge shimmered and solidified under his hooves. He had proven his courage.

Crossing the Bridge of Courage, Donald felt stronger, not just in muscle, but in heart. He had faced his fear and chosen to help another. On the other side, the world opened wide: hills of color, trees of silver leaves, and creatures he had only ever dreamed of meeting.

But Donald knew his journey wasn't over. With the lamb at his side and stars above, he turned to explore the lands beyond the bridge. And so, Donald the Bull, brave and kind, walked into the unknown, ready for whatever adventure the next dawn would bring.
