"Story time with me TV, where books come alive." In the misty peaks of Fogtail Mountain, Mark the Dragon lived in a cozy cave filled with books, maps, and curious old artifacts. Mark wasn't like the other dragons who soared high and breathed fire; he preferred reading scrolls and exploring forgotten places on foot.

One crisp morning, Mark woke to find something strange. The cave was cold, and his usual puff of flame was missing. He tried to sneeze a spark, hiccup a flicker, and even burp a blaze, but nothing happened. His fire was gone.

Panicked but intrigued, Mark decided to investigate. Dragons didn't just lose their flame, not without a reason. He packed a satchel with a magnifying glass, his favorite trail mix, and a map of the mountain trails, then set off into the fog. The first stop was Ember Glenn, where fireflies danced all day. He asked the Flamekeeper Beetle if any odd magic had passed through. "The air has been quiet," the beetle buzzed, "but the wind smells strange near the hollow oak." That was clue number one.

Mark climbed down steep stone paths to the Hollow Oak, an ancient tree crackling with old magic and creaky secrets. He sniffed the air and found a trail of ash leading into the Whispering Tunnels, a network of caves no dragon dared enter. But Mark wasn't like other dragons. With a deep breath, he ducked into the tunnel, his tail swishing in the dark.

*Guided by a trail of ash, Mark ducks into the ancient, glowing, and eerie Whispering Tunnels.*

Inside, the walls shimmered with glowing moss, and strange whispers tickled his ears: *“Too hot, too cold, too bright.”* At the heart of the tunnel, he found a small lizard shivering beside a locked flame jar. Mark recognized his fire, trapped and swirling inside the glass.

"I didn't mean to steal it," the lizard squeaked. "I just wanted to be warm." His tiny hands trembled with guilt. Mark knelt beside him, his golden eyes soft. "Everyone deserves warmth," he said gently, "but flames aren't meant to be stolen."

*Mark gently comforts the tiny, shivering lizard who confessed to stealing the dragon's fire.*

He opened his satchel and gave the lizard his wool scarf and some trail mix. Then he examined the flame jar's puzzle lock. It had ancient runes that shifted when touched. Mark used clues from his map and books to slowly solve the glowing riddle. With a final twist, the jar popped open, and a swirl of golden fire whooshed out, rejoining Mark's chest with a warm thump.

The tunnel lit up with gentle light. The whispers quieted, and the little lizard smiled, no longer cold or afraid. Mark offered to help the lizard build a proper fire nest and left a small flame crystal behind to keep him warm. As he climbed out of the tunnel, the fog parted and sunlight poured over the mountain. Mark's wings flared with pride.

Back at his cave, the books seemed brighter, the maps more inviting, and Mark's fire danced happily whenever he spoke. But he didn't forget the lesson: warmth is meant to be shared, not hoarded, and sometimes mysteries hide lonely hearts. From that day on, Mark became Fogtail’s unofficial firefinder, not just of lost heat, but of the light in others, too.
