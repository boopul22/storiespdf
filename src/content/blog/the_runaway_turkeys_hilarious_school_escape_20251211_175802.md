Welcome to "Read Aloud with Mr. Paul." I’m so glad you could be here. Be sure to subscribe so you won't miss a single story. Today, we'll be reading *How to Catch a Turkey* by Adam Wallace and Andy Elkerton. A quick note: no turkeys were harmed in the making of this book.

Thanksgiving time is here again, but there’s a turkey on the run. Can you catch this tricky bird before the school play has begun? *How to Catch a Turkey* begins on Thanksgiving Day. It’s that special time of year. "Yes, I know I am a turkey," the narrator announced. "That much should be clear. So, gather around. I have a tale, and it’s really quite a story. What I tell you now is not a joke; it is my crowning glory. Gobble, gobble, gobble."

It all began one year ago. I was at a school, you see. Play preparations were underway, but that didn't matter to me until I overheard a group of kids walking by in silly clothes talking about the play. "We’ll even have a turkey on stage," one said. "It’s perfect for Thanksgiving Day." *Do it!* "Turkey on stage? No way. No how!" Had I really heard that right? I instantly broke out of my pen and ran away, suffering a severe case of stage fright.

I burst into the science room, knocking over flasks and beakers. The cry of "Catch that turkey!" boomed over the loudspeakers, alerting the entire school. Now, more children joined the chase, armed with catapults and food. But their goopy mashed potatoes weren't enough to keep me glued. Gobble, gobble, gobble.

Up next, there was a maze of books that stretched from wall to wall. But with a big hop and a mighty flap, I managed to escape it all. I ducked past chairs, bags, and desks. That was quite the trick! The kids thought they could stop me there, but I was much too quick. I snorted and ran outside to the jungle gym, thinking I could hide, but the recess yard was all tricked out. I realized I would have better luck inside. Gobble, gobble, gobble.

Finally, the kids gave up, but the principal herself gave chase. My only hope of escaping her was keeping up my pace. I slid into the coach’s room and crashed into a chair. I got tangled up in jerseys, but I certainly wasn't going to get stuck in there. I ran, eventually hitting a curtain. There was nowhere else to go. I couldn't get past the principal, but the curtain led directly to the show.

*The panicked pursuit ends when the turkey accidentally finds his true calling as the school's beloved new mascot.*

My heart was racing, and I started to sweat. I couldn't squawk or run. I took a deep breath, gasping and sighing. "I can do this," I thought. "Who knows? This might be fun." Suddenly, a kid stood up and pointed. "Oh my gosh, he's so cute!" A parent agreed, "He really is, in his little mascot suit." I started to smile and even dance while the crowd continued to cheer. I was filled with joy that I took the chance, and that's what started my mascot career.

"Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!" (Laughter followed.) Thank you so much for joining me for "Read Aloud with Mr. Paul." Until next time, discover the wonder in a book. Pick one up, take a look. For more fun stories, please like and subscribe to "Read Aloud with Mr. Paul." Thanks again.
